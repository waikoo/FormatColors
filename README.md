## What is this?

This is a Chrome extension that converts any numbers of colors given on frontendmentor.io style-guide.md files in the following format:

```

### Neutral

- Almost White: hsl(0, 0%, 98%)
- Medium Gray: hsl(0, 0%, 41%)
- Almost Black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%)

```

to SCSS or CSS readable format by fetching more exact color names from thecolorapi.com API and adding specific prefixes. It extracts only the HSL values from the input field so don't worry about leaving something like `### Neutral` inside, it can handle it.

Example output SCSS:

```scss
$Alabaster: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
$GraniteGray: hsl(0, 0%, 41%);
$EerieBlack: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
```

Example output CSS:

```css
--clr-Alabaster: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
--clr-GraniteGray: hsl(0, 0%, 41%);
--clr-EerieBlack: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
```
